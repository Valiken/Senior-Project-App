Considerations for the Application: 

    1. Convert from Bootstrap 2.3 -> 3.0 on the basis that 3.0 is built as a mobile first technology. 
    2. Consider removing the requirement for local storage. As it stands having local storage included in the application seem redundant and unnecessary.

      <!--This is the view for the fingertip guide. 
      
      The main purpose of this section will be to show information that is currently provided through the print version of the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools Fingertip Facts. 

      The way that the information is going to be handled is by splitting it up into separate smaller views to create a more viewable solution on a mobile platform.

      The main views will be: 

      1. Superintendents
      2. School Districts

      The extra views that will be provided for basic background and data will be: 

      3. General Information 
      4. County Superintendent & Board 
      5. County & school district information 
      6. Teacher information 
      7. Enrollment in other programs

      In total there will be 7 views as stated above.
