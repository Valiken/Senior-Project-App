==================

OVERVIEW: 

This is the project base for our Senior Project at Cal Poly Pomona. 

The goal of this project is to use PhoneGap to quickly and easily build a mobile application that will be ready to deploy to iOS, Android, and Windows Phone by the end of our ten week class session. 

We plan to access an existing Joomla MySQL Database and use that information to display the content for our application. 

==================

GOAL: 

  1. Code at least a working Android application that can be successfully deployed to a device and will show information taken from an online MySQL 
  2. Replace the existing paper version of this information with an easy to use and view mobile version of it. 
  3. Hopefully combine and leverage all of the information needed to access this data into one database for future expansion and data integrity. 
  
==================

TODO: 

  1. Layout system requirements and design ideas for the project so that we can proceed with the project. 
  2. Begin designing the API that will be used within Joomla to send the information from that database to our mobile application. 
  3. Begin designing the interface and back end for the mobile application using PhoneGap. 
  4. More to come as requirements are fleshed out and other possible implementations are thought of.
